<h1>Hello, my name is Anand Mahadevan.</h1>

<p>I love to solve problems, and that essence of me has grown a great interest with computer programming.</p>
<p>I've coded a graphical text game in Java with the purpose to teach math, and have produced a video on youtube documenting the key aspects of my program, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flAGKG9pSH4">MathFlight.java</a></p>
<p>I have also learned Python, and C++.</p>
<p>I'm pursuing my B.S. CS student at UCR, and am interested in data science. </p>
